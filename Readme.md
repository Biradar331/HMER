    pytorch == 1.0
3. Install all the necessary modules using pip ...
4. Download the model 
5. unzip the off_image_train and off_image_test
6. test the model by running the densenet_testway.py 
7. Run the finalTK.py for the interface of the final project(Prediction system)
8. save the results in training_data folder

### To Work in Virtual ENV
1. Go to Virtual ENvironment using cmd as venv\scripts\activate


TO Do list for upcoming days to work on the project are
1. Create graphs for testing and prediction accuracy along with other's result visualization like needed
2. work on the interface or the aspect ration of the interface 
3. Testing with the new picture created by us
